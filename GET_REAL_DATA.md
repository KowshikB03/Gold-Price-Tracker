# ðŸ”‘ How to Get Real-Time Gold Price Data

Currently, the app may be showing **simulated data** (around $2,750) because free APIs have CORS restrictions or rate limits. Here's how to get **real-time data** showing the actual market price ($2,700-$2,800+):

## âœ… Best Option: GoldAPI.io (Recommended)

**Why?** Free tier, reliable, and easy to set up.

### Steps:

1. **Sign up for free** at [https://www.goldapi.io/](https://www.goldapi.io/)
   - No credit card required
   - 100 requests per month free

2. **Get your API key** from the dashboard

3. **Update the code** in `src/App.js`:

Find line 22 and replace:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://www.goldapi.io/api/XAU/USD');
```

With:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://www.goldapi.io/api/XAU/USD', {
  headers: {
    'x-access-token': 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

4. **Save and refresh** - You'll now see real-time prices! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Test: Check Your Data Source

Look at the badge below the price in your app:
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green badge** = Real-time data (you're good!)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow "Demo Mode"** = Simulated data (follow steps above)

Also check the browser console (F12 â†’ Console):
- You'll see which API is being used
- Or a message saying "Using simulated gold price data"

## ðŸ’¡ Why Use an API Key?

**Free public APIs have limitations:**
- CORS restrictions (browser blocks requests)
- Rate limits (too many requests = blocked)
- Less reliable uptime

**With an API key:**
- âœ… Real-time accurate prices
- âœ… No CORS issues
- âœ… More reliable
- âœ… Still FREE (within limits)

## ðŸš€ Current Market Price

As of October 2024, gold is trading around:
- **$2,700 - $2,800 per troy ounce**

If you see prices around $2,750 with small variations, you're likely seeing simulated data. Real prices will match current market conditions and show more realistic fluctuations.

## ðŸ†˜ Need Help?

1. Check the browser console (F12) for error messages
2. Make sure you copied the API key correctly
3. Verify your API key is active in your provider's dashboard
4. Check you haven't exceeded your free tier limits

**Still stuck?** The app works fine with simulated data for learning and demonstration purposes!
