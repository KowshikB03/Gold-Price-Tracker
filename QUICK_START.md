## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Why is the price not exactly $2,700-$2,800?**  
A: If you see ~$2,750 with small changes, you're in demo mode. Real prices fluctuate more based on actual market conditions.

**Q: Is demo mode bad?**  
A: Not at all! It's perfect for learning and testing. The app works identically with real or demo data.

**Q: How often does real gold price change?**  
A: Gold trades 24/5 (closed weekends). Prices can change every second during trading hours.

**Q: Can I use this in production?**  
A: Yes! Just add a real API key (see GET_REAL_DATA.md) and you're good to go.
