# 🚀 Deployment Guide for Netlify

This guide will help you deploy your Gold Price Tracker to Netlify.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Netlify account (free tier is sufficient)
- Git installed on your computer

## 🔧 Files Prepared for Deployment

Your project is now ready for Netlify deployment with:

✅ **netlify.toml** - Netlify configuration file
✅ **.gitignore** - Comprehensive ignore rules
✅ **package.json** - All dependencies listed
✅ **Build scripts** - Ready to use

## 📝 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "c:/WindSurf Projects/Oct_28"

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Initial commit - Gold Price Tracker"
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the **"+"** icon → **"New repository"**
3. Name it: `gold-price-tracker` (or your preferred name)
4. **Don't** initialize with README (you already have files)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gold-price-tracker.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: Netlify Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to [Netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and log in
2. Click **"Add new site"** → **"Import an existing project"**
3. Choose **"Deploy with GitHub"**
4. Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub
5. Select your `gold-price-tracker` repository
6. Netlify will auto-detect settings from `netlify.toml`:
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `build`
7. Click **"Deploy site"**

#### Option B: Netlify CLI

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI globally
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Step 5: Configure Site (Optional)

After deployment, you can:

1. **Change site name**: Site settings → Change site name
2. **Add custom domain**: Domain settings → Add custom domain
3. **Enable HTTPS**: Automatically enabled by Netlify

## 🎯 Build Settings

The `netlify.toml` file includes:

- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `build`
- **Node version**: 18
- **SPA redirects**: All routes redirect to index.html
- **Security headers**: X-Frame-Options, XSS Protection, etc.
- **Cache headers**: Optimized caching for static assets

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Issue**: Build fails on Netlify

**Solutions**:
1. Check Node version matches (18+)
2. Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
3. Run `npm install` and `npm run build` locally first
4. Check Netlify build logs for specific errors

### Blank Page After Deploy

**Issue**: Site deploys but shows blank page

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify `netlify.toml` has correct publish directory (`build`)
3. Ensure `_redirects` file is in `public/` folder
4. Check that build completed successfully

### API Issues

**Issue**: Gold prices not loading on deployed site

**Solutions**:
1. APIs may have CORS restrictions
2. Check browser console for API errors
3. Consider getting API keys (see `GET_REAL_DATA.md`)
4. Fallback to simulated data will work automatically

## 🌐 Environment Variables (Optional)

If you get API keys later:

1. Go to Netlify Dashboard → Site settings
2. Navigate to **Environment variables**
3. Add your API keys:
   ```
   REACT_APP_GOLD_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ```
4. Redeploy the site

Then update your code to use:
```javascript
const apiKey = process.env.REACT_APP_GOLD_API_KEY;
```

## 📊 Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:

- [ ] All files are committed to Git
- [ ] `npm run build` works locally
- [ ] No sensitive data in code (API keys, etc.)
- [ ] `.gitignore` is properly configured
- [ ] `netlify.toml` is in root directory
- [ ] GitHub repository is created
- [ ] Code is pushed to GitHub

## 🎉 Post-Deployment

After successful deployment:

1. **Test the site**: Visit your Netlify URL
2. **Check functionality**: Verify gold prices load
3. **Test mobile**: Check responsive design
4. **Share**: Your app is live!

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

Netlify automatically redeploys when you push to GitHub:

```bash
# Make changes to your code
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature"
git push

# Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy!
```

## 📱 Your Live Site

After deployment, your site will be available at:
```
https://YOUR-SITE-NAME.netlify.app
```

You can customize the subdomain or add a custom domain in Netlify settings.
