## 🌐 Netlify Build Settings

When you import to Netlify, it will auto-detect these settings from `netlify.toml`:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Build command | `npm run build` |
| Publish directory | `build` |
| Node version | 18 |
| Functions directory | N/A |

**You don't need to configure anything manually!**

## 🎨 Customization After Deployment

### Change Site Name
1. Go to Site settings
2. Click "Change site name"
3. Enter your preferred subdomain

### Add Custom Domain
1. Go to Domain settings
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow the DNS configuration steps

### Environment Variables (Optional)
If you get API keys later:
1. Go to Site settings → Environment variables
2. Add: `REACT_APP_GOLD_API_KEY`
3. Redeploy the site

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

After initial deployment, Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy when you:

```bash
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update feature"
git push

# Netlify automatically rebuilds! 🎉
```

## 📊 Expected Build Output

Your Netlify build should show:

```
✓ Installing dependencies
✓ Building React app
✓ Optimizing production build
✓ Creating static files
✓ Deploy successful!
```

Build time: ~2-3 minutes

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check Node version (should be 18)
- Run `npm install` and `npm run build` locally first
- Check Netlify build logs for specific errors

### Blank Page
- Verify `netlify.toml` has correct publish directory
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure `_redirects` file exists

### API Issues
- APIs may have CORS restrictions
- App will fallback to simulated data automatically
- Consider getting API keys (see GET_REAL_DATA.md)

## 🎉 Success Indicators

After successful deployment, you should see:

✅ Build completes without errors
✅ Site is accessible at your Netlify URL
✅ Gold price displays correctly
✅ All features work
✅ Responsive on mobile
✅ No console errors

## 📱 Your Live Site

After deployment:
```
https://YOUR-SITE-NAME.netlify.app
```

## 🎊 Next Steps

2. **Test the live site** - Verify all features work
3. **Customize site name** - Make it memorable
4. **Share your app** - Add to portfolio, share with friends
5. **Get API keys** (optional) - For guaranteed real-time data
